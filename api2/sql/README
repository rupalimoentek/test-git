This directory contains all changes, additions, and population of the PostgreSQL DB for
project codename Crouching Tiger.  The idea of this is to be able to keep many copies
of the database in sync with each other, while still enabling different environments
to operate at different release points. This is relevant not just for the development
and staging platforms, although they are both directly updated using these scripts, but
for each developers locally running DB instance - should they have one.

It is key that all needed DB changes be included in these files and that they be in sequence,
so that should anyone for any reason want a current version of the DB, all that need be done
is run all of the query files in chronological order and they will have a working copy of the
DB.  The naming convention of the files uses the date and version (or hour and minute) as the
filename in the format of YYYYMMDD_vvvv.sql or by time if you like YYYYMMDD_hhmm.sql

Please insure that you SQL statement that you save in these files will execute correctly.
